<h1 align="center"> The Future Pay: Analysis on the Potential Effects of Increasing Minimum Wage in the Philippines

<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
 <p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Households in extreme poverty and low-income families in the Philippines struggle and suffer as they lack access to valuable assets and basic necessities, resulting in hunger, unemployment, and restricted access to sustain their everyday lives. They mainly rely on one of their family member's hard work, beg on the street, and sometimes do things that can generate income merely to live. Some are forced to endure their situations and skip their meals just to ensure that their earnings are sufficient for them to last a week. However, there are also government initiatives and services available to help them, including the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps) to alleviate their needs. But usually, to survive their situation, they will need to work day and night to prolong productivity and get higher pay because of the low minimum wage mandated by the Law. The minimum wage is important because it specifies the lowest amount of compensation that a company may pay its employees in order to provide social security and assist to improve their standard of life. The Philippines is ranked as one of the countries with the lowest minimum wage providing its people, which has led to having been considered to be one of the worst places to survive (Picodi, 2020). Under the current labor regulations of DOLE, minimum wages in the Philippines have remained unchanged at Php 537/ day from 2019 to the present,  which is insufficient to meet basic necessities such as food, water, health, education, and electricity, especially in light of the pandemic and rising commodity prices in the market today.

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum wage is the smallest amount of money that a firm can pay its employees for the job and services they offer and do, at which workers are also permitted to sell their labor under Republic Act No.602 often known as the Minimum Wage Law, which was enacted in the Philippines. According to the findings of the study conducted by Cacnio in 2017, standard economic theory has predicted that somehow raising the minimum wage of the workers and increasing them would result in a negligible influence on the regional pricing, however, this is just minimal and would not result in inflationary pressures. Moreover, the minimum wage can only increase once a year – unless there are extenuating circumstances – and may not result in pay push inflation. In a company, the standard in their profit maximization is that they can only increase their workforce for as long as the cost of getting an extra worker is less than the increased income it generates for the firm. That is, a company will only recruit more workers if their profit and revenue also increase. This means that the minimum wage in companies may vary depending on their market, but not minimal and still follows the Minimum Wage Law mandated by the government. The researchers conducted this study as they also stand and believe in protecting our Filipino workers not just in our society but also to enable their skill creation and development as an individual. This helps in assuring that these employees are getting what they deserve in exchange for the service and productivity they provide.
 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, the analysis of this study focuses on its objectives to develop a labor policy and recommendation of an action plan for raising the minimum wage of the Filipinos, which will not only help combat poverty and unemployment in the Philippines but will also encourage economic growth and development in the country. Changes to minimum wages are necessary to sustain its relevance in fluctuating economic and social realities from time to time. The goal of this project is to also encourage more Filipinos to stay in the Philippines and work for our own country, which again will empower and benefit the Philippines by providing possibilities for growth to our economy and optimizing the Filipino skills and intelligence that we have rather than going abroad away from their families and sometimes experience kinds of discrimination and abuse.

<h3> Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) </h3>
<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SDGs which this project aims to attain are to End Poverty and Decent Work and Economic Growth. These SDGs are further described as follows:

 <h3 align=center><b>Goal 1: End Poverty</b></h3>

<h3> Problem Statement </h3>

<p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing Rate of Labor Migration.</b> Based on a survey conducted by the World Economic Forum in 2019, the Philippine youth still prefers to work overseas owing to the country's high unemployment rate, better opportunities,  higher salaries and higher minimum wage given in other countries compared to working here. It is evident that economic growth in the Philippines is quite low since Filipinos choose to work abroad granting them more gains and expansion for other nations while leaving our own country behind in terms of economic progress. 

<p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unemployment Rate falls but Job Quality worsens.</b> Another problem is that the labor population in the Philippines is low since it is not completely employed because there’s only a certain percentage of working-age Filipinos in the country that are either unemployed or underemployed, at almost twice the level of our neighboring countries. According to the Labor Force Survey performed by the Philippine Statistics Authority in January 2022, 2.93 million Filipinos are unemployed at 6.4 percent, which is excellent news because it indicates a decrease from the percentage recorded the previous year. However, when compared to other nations, the Philippines' unemployment rate appears to be high, necessitating additional analysis and attention. This also suggests that the higher the unemployment rate, the more difficult it is for Filipinos to satisfy their basic necessities. The visible underemployment rate, defined as the proportion of those working less than 40 hours per week who expressed a desire to work more hours in their current job, find another job, or find a new job with longer working hours, was estimated to be 9.8 percent in December 2021, down from 11.5 percent in November of the same year. Filipinos are losing morale as a result of the unemployment situation, as well as the low wages they are receiving. With such a low minimum salary, what do you believe Filipinos do in their daily lives?

<p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing Population and Poverty.</b> Another concern here is the rising percentage of poverty among poor Filipinos whose income per capita is inadequate to cover their basic needs, which was estimated at 23.7 percent or the equivalent of 26.14 million Filipinos who live below the poverty line (Dennis Mapa, 2021). This is because even if some members of poor households work, they still get P537/day which is incapable of meeting the everyday needs of a single household, according to the Picodi study in 2020.

<h3> Significance of the Proposed Project </h3>

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed project intends to address this issue, as well as the country's minimum wage and poverty rate. This research is highly significant to the following recipients:

<p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the citizens and the community.</b> To the citizens and the community. This project allows them to have an insight into the trends with regards to the issues. They needed to be able to attain knowledge of the key benefits they can attain once the issues are addressed. It would allow the citizens and the community to be educated and have their rights to labor more protected.

<p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the government  and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).</b> This project enables them to have useful information for the improvement and alignment of their policies. They can strengthen their laws and norms even further, as well as the concreteness of their initiatives. The government can serve as a link between citizens and opportunities by acting as a bridge, especially among those in the poor sector. The project will be beneficial to them because it will allow them to provide better service to the people while also raising awareness. With this, they will gain more knowledge about this matter and will help them choose and decide whats the best for everyone. 
 
<p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Filipino workers and employees.</b> The result of the project creates a better understanding of the key factors and benefits of the adjusted minimum wage fare for workers and employees. This project will assist in making every worker aware of the changes that a wage increase can bring. The information formed is utilized to increase employees' awareness and attention to the problem of the minimum wage in the Philippines. This will greatly benefit the Filipino workers and employees because this can help them understand more about the matters affecting the wage they can earn from working.
 
 <p align=justify><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the future researchers.</b> The information and analysis made by the team can be used for a more in-depth understanding of the phenomenon. This project will act as a guide and a source of support for future research. The project will certainly give them a good background and overview of the analysis and effects of the minimum wage in the Philippines especially the factors affecting it.

<h3> Methods </h3>

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers will be using the datasets available provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority to assess and predict the possible effects of increasing the minimum wage in the Philippines and determine whether it is effective, feasible or not. The datasets to be used include the Poverty Rate among the population of Poor Filipinos whose per capita income is inadequate for their livelihood, which can also be used to compare and assess other countries’ poverty rates whose minimum wage is sufficient for their living and necessities, based on the report conducted by Picodi. Furthermore, this study will use a dataset that includes statistics for the unemployment rate reported in the Philippines as well as determining the significant correlation that it has in relation to the Philippines' minimum wage, in comparison to other nations, in order to identify the potential impact it provides, upon increasing the minimum wage for its people.

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approaches for analyzing the mentioned datasets and their relevant relationships with one another are as follows:

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistical analysis will be utilized by the researchers which comprise data collection of all relevant details needed to evaluate and assess the factors that may affect the increase in the minimum wage. This technique will also be used to quantify all of the obtained data and perform different statistical operations to see whether the cost of a country's minimum wage influences the unemployment and poverty percentages reported. The use of predictive analysis would also be used to identify critical patterns and trends in order to predict what potential effects might occur if the Philippines increased its minimum wage through competitive differentiation and comparison with other countries that have a sufficient minimum wage for its nation.

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the researchers would also employ Linear Regression Analysis to test for the significance of discontinuity between the treatment and control groups to be allocated. Since evaluating the potential effects of a minimum wage increase will be our primary focus, this technique will help us understand how one variable is affected by another, whether it will remain the same or change, giving us a better understanding of their relationships, allowing us to anticipate possible outcomes and suggest various courses of action and recommendations for the government based on the given result in the future.

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the researchers will use Python as their primary programming language in order to perform better classification and statistical analysis as it's flexible and can handle complicated datasets available for analysis.

<h3> Expected Output </h3>

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to generate fact-based information that will be used to gain a better understanding of the impact of the minimum wage on Filipinos' lives. This project is designed to improve the interpretation and understanding of the data collected through better visualization of concepts and ideas that are easier to grasp and understand by analyzing the significant impact of the Philippines' low minimum wage on poverty and unemployment rates, which are two of the country's most pressing challenges today. Also, this will provide a clearer picture of the potential effects if the government raises the minimum wage for Filipino employees in the future and determine whether it would be favorable or not in order to help eliminate the aforementioned issues. The team will then create a labor policy and recommendation for an action plan based on the gathered data, which will include all of the benefits and drawbacks of the minimum wage rise. The data that will be collected and tested will serve as the criteria for deciding whether or not to reform and implement the convention and policy against the minimum wage in the Philippines. However, regardless of the result of the analysis of the datasets presented, awareness of policies, norms, and suggestions will still be delivered and communicated to the entire nation to assess and evaluate what action should be taken next. The project's outcomes would address the challenges surrounding the country's minimum wage, as well as its implications for the business process, labor code, and labor market. This helps the team design strategies for the betterment of the nation that are just and match the needs of every Filipino. This initiative provides the project's conclusion, summary, and recommendation to everyone, and notably to those most concerned about the country's minimum wage.
